# USER CUSTOMIZABLE  GESTURES — loaded BEFORE built-in
# defaults in CMD_DICTand thus have higher precedence since
# commandsare matched in the order they have been added.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Contents is a series of json key-value pairs separated by commas, where
#  - Each Key is a Gesture String of form:
#       N-[MOUSE|TOUCH|ANY]_M-[CLICKTAP|CLICK|TAP|DRAG|SWIPE|LONG|CORNER_TOP|ANY]
#    where:
#       N = The contact set during the gesture. Either:
#         - Digit representing (maximum) number of contacts (buttons or fingers)- e.g.,  2
#         - List of button names and/or numbers of specific buttons pressed (if a mouse) - e.g., [Left, Right] or [1, 3] or [Left, 3] etc.
#         - 'A' (wildcard)
#       M = Number of clicks/taps in the gesture (e.g., 1 for single-click, 2 for double-click etc) or 'A' (wildcard)
#       ANY = Wildcard for any of the string entries (eg., for device type or gesture type)
#
#    Examples include:
#       3-TOUCH_1-TAP
#       2-TOUCH_2-SWIPE_RIGHT
#       [Left,Right]-MOUSE_1-DRAG
#       A-ANY_A-ANY          ← wildcard fallback
#
#    Notes:
#       1. DRAG and SWIPE differ in velocity -- i.e., SWIPE is *faster*
#       2. The gestures DRAG and SWIPE can also have the optional suffixes: _LEFT, _RIGHT, _UP, or _DOWN
#       3. Conversely, DRAG and SWIPE serve as wildcard matches relative to their directional counterparts
#       4. LONG can take the optional suffix _CLICK or _TAP
#       5. CORNER_TOP activates when click or tap is in the extreme top-right corner of the scree
#       6. DRAG, SWIPE, and LONG gestures (and their variants) are by definition only single-click
#       7. Matching is case insensitive
#       8. Entries are matched in order, so that you should always go from particular to more general when using wildcards
#
#  - Each Value is an Action Command which can be expressed in one of the following 3 forms:
#    1. Single command string - e.g., "ls -a -l"
#    2. List of one or more commands each of which is can be one of the following forms:
#        - String form - e.g., ["echo hello"]
#        - List of argv-style component string - e.g., ["ls", "-a", "-l"]
#       Example: ["echo hello", ["ls", "-a", "-l"]]
#    3. Dictionary with required key "cmds" and optional keys: "msg", "timeout"
#        where the value of "cmds" is of form 1 or 2
#        e.g., {"cmds": "ls -al", "msg": "list all files", "timeout": 1}
#        e.g., {"cmds": ["echo hello", ["ls" "-al"]], "msg": "echo hello and list all files", "timeout": 5}
#
# Note enclosing top-level braces are optional and final entry can optionally
# end with a comma.
#
# Note content following '#' is skipped.
# If you want to include a '#' in a string, escape it with '\' (i.e. '\#')

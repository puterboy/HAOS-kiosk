# USER CUSTOMIZABLE  GESTURES — loaded BEFORE built-in
# defaults in CMD_DICTand thus have higher precedence since
# commandsare matched in the order they have been added.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Contents is a series of json key-value pairs separated by commas, where
#  - Each Key is a Gesture String of form:
#       <CONTACTS>_<DEVICE>_<CLICKS>_<GESTURE>
#    where:
#       <CONTACTS> = The maximal contact set during the gesture. Either:
#         - Number (N, N+, N-) representing (maximum) number of contacts (buttons or fingers)
#           where N+ and N- are respectively greater than and less than or equal to N
#         - List of button numbers and/or corresponding button names if a mouse
#           (e.g., [Left, Right] or [1, 3] or [Left, 3])
#
#       <DEVICE> =  Either:
#           - Device Type (e.g., MOUSE, TOUCH) or the wildcard "ANY"
#           - Device Name (e.g., Button, Finger)
#
#       <CLICKS> = Number (M, M+, M-) of clicks/taps in the gesture where M+ and M-
#                  are respectively greater than or less than or equal to M
#                  (e.g., 1 for single-click, 2 for double-click, 2+ for 2 or more clicks)
#
#      <GESTURE> = Either:
#           - GestureType (e.g., CLICKTAP, DRAG, SWIPE, LONG, CORNER_TOP) or the wildcard "ANY"
#           - Gesture Name (e.g., Click, Tap, Drag, Swipte, Long Click, Long Tap)
#               Note that gesture names are device specific (e.g. Click for Mouse, Tap for Touch)
#
#         where:
#           - ANY is a wildcard match for any gesture
#           - DRAG and SWIPE differ in velocity -- i.e., SWIPE is *faster*
#           - The gestures DRAG and SWIPE can also have the optional suffixes: _LEFT, _RIGHT, _UP, or _DOWN
#           - Conversely, DRAG and SWIPE serve as wildcard matches relative to their directional counterparts
#           - LONG can take the optional suffix _CLICK or _TAP
#           - CORNER_TOP activates when click or tap is in the extreme top-right corner of the scree
#           - DRAG, SWIPE, and LONG gestures (and their variants) are by definition only single-click
#           - Matching is case insensitive
#
#    NOTE: Keys are matched in order, so that you should always go from particular to more general when using wildcards
#    NOTE: Validity checks are imposed including:
#            - Cannot have more than 1 click for single click gestures
#            - Click and Tap gesture woreds  correspond only to Mouse and Touch devices
#
# Example gesture strings include:
#    [Left, Right]_MOUSE_3_CLICKTAP
#    [1,2,3]_MOUSE_1+_CORNER_TOP
#    2_TOUCH_1_DRAG_LEFT
#    2_Button_1_Long Click
#    3_Finger_2_Tap
#    2+_Finger_1_Swipe_down
#    1_ANY_2-_CLICKTAP
#    1+_ANY_1+_ANY
#
# Invalid examples include:
#    1-Mouse_3-Tap  (Tap is for Touch)
#    1-Touch_2-Long (Long gestures can only be single contact)
#
#  - Each Value is an Action Command which can be expressed in one of the following 3 forms:
#    1. Single command string - e.g., "ls -a -l"
#       Note that an empty string acts as a No-Op -- i.e., it will be ignored and can be
#       used with wildcard gestures to block actions of lower priority.
#
#    2. List of one or more commands each of which is can be one of the following forms:
#        - String form - e.g., ["echo hello"]
#        - List of argv-style component string - e.g., ["ls", "-a", "-l"]
#       Example: ["echo hello", ["ls", "-a", "-l"]]
#
#    3. Dictionary with required key "cmds" and optional keys: "msg", "timeout"
#        where the value of "cmds" is of form 1 or 2
#        e.g., {"cmds": "ls -al", "msg": "list all files", "timeout": 1}
#        e.g., {"cmds": ["echo hello", ["ls" "-al"]], "msg": "echo hello and list all files", "timeout": 5}
#
# Note enclosing top-level braces are optional and final entry can optionally
# end with a comma.
#
# Note content following '#' is skipped.
# If you want to include a '#' in a string, escape it with '\' (i.e. '\#')

# Add-on: HAOS Kiosk Display (haoskiosk)
# File: run.sh

# Includes option to select FBDEV0 (framebuffer 0 or /dev/fb0) or
# FBDEV1 (framebuffer 1 or /dev/fb1) which should correspond with
# HDM1 and HDM2 video outputs.
# Unfortunately, current HAOS implementation on RPi mirrors all output on both
# HDM1 and HDM2 (including console output) so doesn't make a difference.
# NOTE: Ideally one would keep console on HDM1 and run X on HDM2
# to avoid conflict and over-writing
